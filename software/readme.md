# Software
## Linux Installation
See software/petalinux/readme.txt for instructions on how to run Ubuntu Desktop Linux from the SD card of the ZCU104.  Honestly, this process is pretty easy. You can probably do all the steps in less than thirty minutes. Look at software/petalinux/readme.txt. That flow results in a reliable boot of Unbuntu on the ZCU104.
## Simple C++ FPGA access using GCC under Ubuntu
See software/app/ultra_ram folder. Build and run this on the ZCU104.
## Open Source Linux (OSL) Ubuntu flow
Look under software/OSL/readme.md.  Right now these instructions don't result in a a successful Ubuntu installation. I prefer working from primary source but could not get this to work. I may come back to it later.
