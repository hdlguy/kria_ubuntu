# kria_ubuntu
## A project to demonstrate Xilinx Kria running Ubuntu

The Xilinx Multi-Processor System On Chip (MPSOC) devices provide agile solutions to a large class of problems.

### Tasks:
- **Create a simple FPGA Design** - See the readme under fpga for instructions.  There is a block ram and a register file that can be access from a program running under Ubuntu Linux.
- **Demonstrate basic access to FPGA features from Linux** - Look in software/app/bram_test.
